# Converting Decimal To Binary
## Dividing By Two
The most common and simple way to convert numbers to binary. 
### 1. Divide and Write
- [] First, take your number and divide it by two
- [] If it does not divide evenly, record the remainder as 1. If it divides without a remainder, record the remainder as 0. 
### 2. Repeat the Process
- [] Repeat the process recording the 1's and 0's until there is not a whole number to divide
### 3. Read the Result 
- [] Read the remainders backwards(from last to first) 
### 4. Example Using 13
| Step | Process | Quotient | Remainder |
|------|---------|----------|-----------|
|  1   |   13/2  |     6    |     1     |
|  2   |   6/2   |     3    |     0     |
|  3   |   3/2   |     1    |     1     |
|  4   |   1/2   |     0    |     1     |
### 5. Result
**Since we must read the result from last to first remainder, the number 13 in binary would be 1011
